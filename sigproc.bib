abstract = {Most software attacks rely on some predictable behavior on the target platform, and so mass distribution of identical software facilitates mass exploitation. As a countermeasure, there has been a resurgent interest in moving target defenses in general and biologically inspired artificial software diversity in particular. While the concept of software diversity has interested researchers for over twenty years, technical obstacles have prevented its widespread adoption until now. But now, massive-scale software diversity has become practical due to the Internet (enabling distribution of individualized software) and cloud computing (computational power to perform diversification). In this article, we take stock of the current state of software diversity research, and what we see is quite encouraging. It turns out that the potential show-stopper issues are now mostly solved, but a few lesser concerns still separate us from widespread adoption. We describe these remaining issues and point to a realistic adoption path.},

abstract = {Redundancy and diversity are commonly applied principles for fault tolerance against accidental faults. Their use in security, which is attracting increasing interest, is less general and less of an accepted principle. In particular, redundancy without diversity is often argued to be useless against systematic attack, and diversity to be of dubious value. This paper discusses their roles and limits, and to what extent lessons from research on their use for reliability can be applied to security, in areas such as intrusion detection. We take a probabilistic approach to the problem, and argue its validity for security. We then discuss the various roles of redundancy and diversity for security, and show that some basic insights from probabilistic modelling in reliability and safety indeed apply to examples of design for security.We discuss the factors affecting the efficacy of redundancy and diversity, the role of “independence” between layers of defense, and some of the trade-offs facing designers.},

@article{Homescu2013,
abstract = {Code-reuse attacks are notoriously hard to defeat, and most current solutions to the problem focus on automated software diversity. This is a promising area of research, as diversity attacks the common denominator enabling code-reuse attacksthe software monoculture. Recent research in this area provides security, but at an unfortunate price: performance overhead. Leveraging previously collected profiling information, compilers can substantially improve subsequent code generation. Traditionally, profile-guided optimization focuses on hot program code, where a program spends most of its execution time. Optimizing rarely executed code does not significantly impact performance, so few optimizations focus on this code. We use profile-guided optimization to reduce the performance overhead of software diversity. The primary insight is that we are free to diversify cold code, but restrict our diversification efforts in hot code. Our work investigates the impact of profiling on an expensive diversification technique: NOP insertion. By differentiating between hot cold and cold code, we optimize NOP insertion overheads from a maximum of 25\% down to a negligible 1\%, while preserving the security properties of the original defense. Consequently, using our profile-guided diversification technique, even randomization techniques having a high performance overhead become practical.},

We introduce a revised setting which permits the definition of a non-interactive analogue, the non-interactive zereknowledge proof of knowledge, and show how it may be constructed in that setting from a non-interactive zero- knowledge proof system for NP (of the type introduced by Blum, Feldman and Micali). We give a formalization of chosen ciphertext attack in our model which is stronger than the “lunchtime attack” considered by Naor and Yung, and prove a non-interactive public-key cryptosystem based on non-interactive zero-knowledge proof proof of knowledge to be secure against it.},

abstract = {When a message is transformed into a ciphertext in a way designed to protect both its privacy and authenticity, there may be additional information, such as a packet header, that travels alongside the ciphertext (at least conceptually) and must get authenticated with it. We formalize and investigate this authenticated-encryption with associated-data (AEAD) problem. Though the problem has long been addressed in cryptographic practice, it was never provided a definition or even a name. We do this, and go on to look at efficient solutions for AEAD, both in general and for the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB. For the general setting we study two simple ways to turn an authenticated-encryption scheme that does not support associated-data into one that does: nonce stealing and ciphertext translation. For the case of OCB we construct an AEAD-scheme by combining OCB and the pseudorandom function PMAC, using the same key for both algorithms. We prove that, despite “interaction” between the two schemes when using a common key, the combination is sound. We also consider achieving AEAD by the generic composition of a nonce-based, privacy-only encryption scheme and a pseudorandom function.},

This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

@article{Merkle1981,
abstract = {In a practical system, a message is often encrypted more than once by different encryptions, here called multiple encryption, to enhance its security. Additionally, new features may be achieved by multiple encrypting a message, such as the key-insulated cryptosystems and anonymous channels. Intuitively, a multiple encryption should remain secure , whenever there is one component cipher unbreakable in it. In NESSIE’s latest Portfolio of recommended cryptographic primitives (Feb. 2003), it is suggested to use multiple encryption with component ciphers based on different assumptions to acquire long term security. However, in this paper we show this needs careful discussion, especially, this may not be true according to adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA), even with all component ciphers CCA-secure. We define an extended model of (standard) CCA called chosen ciphertext attack for multiple encryption (ME-CCA) emulating partial breaking of assumptions, and give constructions of multiple encryption satisfying ME-CCA-security. We further relax CCA by introducing weak ME-CCA (ME-wCCA) and study the relations among these definitions, proving ME-wCCA-security can be acquired by combining IND-CCA-secure component ciphers together. We then apply these results to key-insulated cryptosystem.},

abstract = {Since Rijndael was chosen as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), improving upon 7-round attacks on the 128-bit key variant (out of 10 rounds) or upon 8-round attacks on the 192/256-bit key variants (out of 12/14 rounds) has been one of the most difficult challenges in the cryptanalysis of block ciphers for more than a decade. In this paper, we present the novel technique of block cipher cryptanalysis with bicliques, which leads to the following results: • The first key recovery method for the full AES-128 with computational complexity 2126.1. • The first key recovery method for the full AES-192 with computational complexity 2189.7. • The first key recovery method for the full AES-256 with computational complexity 2254.4. • Key recovery methods with lower complexity for the reduced-round versions of AES not considered before, including cryptanalysis of 8-round AES-128 with complexity 2124.9. • Preimage search for compression functions based on the full AES versions faster than brute force. In contrast to most shortcut attacks on AES variants, we do not need to assume related-keys. Most of our techniques only need a very small part of the codebook and have low memory requirements, and are practically verified to a large extent. As our cryptanalysis is of high computational complexity, it does not threaten the practical use of AES in any way.},

abstract = {Implementations of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol must handle a variety of protocol versions and extensions, authentication modes, and key exchange methods. Confusingly, each combination may prescribe a different message sequence between the client and the server. We address the problem of designing a robust composite state machine that correctly multiplexes between these different protocol modes. We systematically test popular open-source TLS implementations for state machine bugs and discover several critical security vulnerabilities that have lain hidden in these libraries for years, and have now finally been patched due to our disclosures. Several of these vulnerabilities, including the recently publicized FREAK flaw, enable a network attacker to break into TLS connections between authenticated clients and servers. We argue that state machine bugs stem from incorrect compositions of individually correct state machines. We present the first verified implementation of a composite TLS state machine in C that can be embedded into OpenSSL and accounts for all its supported ciphersuites. Our attacks expose the need for the formal verification of core components in cryptographic protocol libraries; our implementation demonstrates that such mechanized proofs are within reach, even for mainstream TLS implementations.},

Specifically, the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though no-one but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous and next hops in the communication chain. This implies that neither the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server. A prototype of Onion Routing has been implemented. This prototype works with HTTP (World Wide Web) proxies. In addition, an analogous proxy for TELNET has been implemented. roxies for FTP and SMTP are under development.},
